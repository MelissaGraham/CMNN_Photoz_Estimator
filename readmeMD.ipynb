    "\n",
    "The color-matched nearest-neighbors (CMNN) photometric redshift (photo-_z_) estimator provides photometric redshifts with an accuracy that is directly dependent on (and only on) the quality of the simulated observed photometry which, as described below, depends directly and only on the $5{\\sigma}$ limiting magnitudes (i.e., the LSST survey depths).\n",
    "This makes it an ideal tool for assessing the impact on photo-_z_ results from different proposed LSST observing strategies that build image depth over time in different ways, or result in different coadded depths."

    "\n",
    "The provided mock catalog (file `mock_catalog.dat`) is described in Graham et al. (2020).\n",
    "It contains simulated galaxies redshifts and magnitudes, and is limited to galaxies with redshifts $<$3.5 and _i_-band magnitudes between 16.0 and 25.3 mag.\n",
    "This matches the $i\\leq25$ mag \"gold sample\" defined by the Science Requirement Document (ls.st/lpm-17), \n",
    "and matches many of the photo-_z_ simulations in the papers listed above.\n",
    "**Please get in touch if you need a catalog that is deeper in the _i_-band.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The catalog columns include a unqiue index, the \"true\" redshift, and the \"true\" apparent magnitude in LSST (SDSS) _ugrizy_ magnitudes, plus a Euclid _Y_ band, and _JHK_.\n",
    "Although 10 bands are provided, only nine are used for the test and training sets, as the user must choose between LSST y (default) or Euclid _Y_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user specifies the size of the test and training sets, and the desired 5-sigma magnitude depth in each filter (i.e., for a given observing strategy).\n",
    "The observed apparent magnitudes and uncertainties for all filters are then simulated, based on the \"true\" magnitudes and the desired depths, as described in the papers above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The photometric error, $\\sigma_{\\rm rand}$, is given in Section 3.2.1 of [IveziÄ‡ et al. (2019)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...873..111I/abstract):\n",

    "$0.037$, $0.038$, $0.039$, $0.039$, $0.04$, and $0.04$ for filters _ugrizy_, respectively.\n",
    "Values of $0.04$ are also used for _JHK_ bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "A random value drawn from a normal distribution with a standard deviation equal to the photometric error for each galaxy is added to the true catalog magnitude to generate observed apparent magnitudes.\n",
    "For example, the photometric error of a galaxy with a true catalog magnitude of $i=24.5$ mag would be $\\sigma_{\\rm rand} = 0.026$; a random normal draw of $0.054$ would lead to an observed apparent magnitude of $i=24.55$ mag.\n",
    "Observed apparent colors are calculated from the observed apparent magnitudes, and the error in the color is the photometric errors added in quadrature.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, test and training sets are simulated based on a given observing strategy and the depth it would achieve in each filter."
